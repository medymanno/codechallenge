## How to Run the Code

1. Copy the JavaScript code into a file or open your browser’s developer console.
2. Open the file in a web browser like Chrome or Firefox.
3. You’ll be asked to:
   - Enter the number of chai cups
   - Enter the distance of your trip
   - Enter the amount of money to send
4. The results will appear in the browser console.
